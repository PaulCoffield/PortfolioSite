          <section>
            <p>
              This client has a long-established website which has an accompanying WebApp for mobile visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Their existing WebApp was incomplete and outdated, the interface needed a visual/interaction refresh and the amount of functionality offered had
              to be increased. With more and more of the clients’ income being generated through their WebApp, it was of high importance to the business that it
              was brought up to the standard expected of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aesthetics and the interactivity options of the app were tired. Whilst still on-brand, the visuals now looked old - the particular style used
              was a mixture of a number of styles, which gave an almost confused look to the WebApp. The interactions offered are jQuery-heavy and in some
              instances act as more of a barrier or delay to accessing content than as a delightful element that adds to the experience. Both of these factors
              led to the interface being perceived as 'clunky'.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not all of the functionality presented via the desktop website is present in the WebApp and the existing members want to be able to use the WebApp
              from their mobile devices to complete everything they would do on desktop.
            </p>

            <h3>User Empathy</h3>

            <p>
              My outputs were being created to serve the development team rather than the end users of this WebApp.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business decision had been made to make sure that adding all desktop functionality to the WebApp was the goal of this project. Whilst this was
              initially a bit jarring, when I evaluated the developers as being the users I was catering for, things became clear once again. I would get the
              opportunity to influence the Information Architecture of the navigation/menu systems, making some changes to add in usability improvements
              wherever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point I mapped out all of the existing functionality in the desktop site and the existing WebApp. This visualised what was required
              overall, as well as what had been achieved in the previous attempt.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>

            <p>
              I wanted to understand what the developers would be expecting from the different deliverables I would create on this project and to see if there
              were any others they’d be able to make use of.
            </p>

            <p>
              After discussions with them, they could see the potential value that would be delivered to them by wireframes and prototypes - both of which would
              serve to answer questions, or rather - stop them from needing to make decisions themselves.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Existing Site Analysis</h3>

            <p>
              Where functionality was already available in the previous WebApp, I completed the various tasks using both the desktop and mobile versions to get
              a better understanding of what they offered and what stages/validation was involved.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Task Flow Wireframes</h3>

            <p>
              Each area of functionality was sketched out in Balsamiq to provide the visual structure of the existing information being presented at each step
              of the flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wireframes were then fed into the Development teams’ sprint board to serve as a reference for how to structure the output from their code.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Interaction Prototypes</h3>
            <p>
              The majority of flows had not previously been consumed/available on a mobile device. In order to demonstrate more complicated interactions, I
              built out prototypes of different sections of the WebApp to give the developers an interactive reference.
            </p>
            <p>
              These prototypes led to developers raising questions about specific scenarios and I was able to iterate over the prototypes to include the answers
              to their questions.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/lwa-2.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <h3>Sematic UI</h3>

            <p>
              The Developers had already made the decision to implement Semantic UI for building out the visual layer, they had setup in their ecosystem and had
              added a custom theme to apply brand colours.
            </p>

            <p>
              I utilised the visual style from the UI Kit when building out the wireframes and prototypes in the earlier stages, though this was done lo-fi to
              keep focus on the overall structure rather than the aesthetic. Hi-fi visuals were then created in Sketch as more screens were being designed and
              prototyped.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/lwa-3.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <h3>Custom Interface Components</h3>
            <p>
              To bring additional value to the development team, and to make the most of my exposure to React, I read through the Semantic UI documentation and
              began to bring together various existing elements to build out custom components for use within the WebApp.
            </p>

            <p>
              This further removed the developers from the need to make visual decisions and presented them with markup templates that they could use as a base
              when creating new pages, allowing them to focus more on wiring up the data to the pre-defined layout.
            </p>
