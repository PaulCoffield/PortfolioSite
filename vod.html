          <h1>Case Study: Video-On-Demand (VOD) content delivery</h1>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/vod-1.jpg" alt=""/></span>
          <p>
            A clients existing platform for delivering VOD content was starting to show its age - aesthetically and technically. Sales had shown a decline along
            with the volume/ frequency of new content being added.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although backend services required updating, it was a safe assumption that these services were not the reason for the decline in sales.
          </p>
          <p><i>To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study.</i></p>

          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            To get a better picture of things I arranged telephone interviews with a number of content creators on the platform, choosing a selection of those
            that uploaded video content and factoring the following variables:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Recent sales</li>
            <li>Recent uploads</li>
            <li>Previous uploads, but none recently</li>
            <li>No uploads</li>
            <li>Self-promotion efforts off-site</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The aim was to clarify how the platform was still being used by different types of user and to get a clearer understanding of who these personas
            actually were. 3 distinct personas became clear among the interviewees, each expressing quite different needs from the platform.
          </p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="images/vod-3.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>

            <p>
              A range of different competitors were mentioned during interviews, these and other indirect competitorsâ€™ sites were reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although most were visually much more modern, the actual product offering/capabilities were very similar across the board - there are no clear
              disruptors in the market.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Existing Site Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              The clients site was re-visited after the interviews and competitor analysis to highlight any additional areas that should be addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google Analytics data was also used to document the true paths of consumers within the site.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/vod-2.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <h3>Task Flow Visualisation</h3>

            <p>
              Each step of the process was documented both as a flow diagram expressing the relationship/s between each step of the process and as a sitemap,
              highlighting the different pages/navigational paths to tackle each step.
            </p>

            <p>
              The same was completed from a consumers perspective, detailing how someone would seek, purchase and consume VOD content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of these added weight to the views expressed by the interviewees that although they were familiar with the processes now, for new users it
              was a massive learning curve just to be able to navigate through the site.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Pricing Model</h3>
            <p>
              A number of interviewees had expressed that they had reduced their content uploads given the pricing model that caused the price of them to be
              inflated automatically if they set it too low.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was another outdated element of the platform that had been implemented at a time when the cost of storage was far greater than it is now.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new calculation was worked out that would allow content creators to be able to upload higher quality content without the fear of price
              inflation.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Visual Design</h3>

            <p>All instances of VOD content within the site were visually updated to give much more prominence to the content.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Embellishment surrounds were removed from thumbnails</li>
              <li>Thumbnail size was increased 100%</li>
              <li>Irrelevant information removed</li>
              <li>Additional features such as preview tiles on scrolling were added</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These changes have led to the VOD content increasing in visibility amongst section home pages with broader audiences.</p>
            <p>
              Within the VOD delivery pages, additional content was added to showcase other content from the same author as well as related content from others.
              Existing branding dictated the style of UI elements so layouts were all created as a wireframes in Balsamiq, providing enough detail for the
              development team to carry out the technical updates, without being distracted by visuals treatments.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Results</h3>

            <p>
              The slowing of sales seems to have been combated with the visual and technical updates that have been implemented. Sales continue to rise month on
              month. As does not only the volume of content uploads, but also the number of content creators actively adding new content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The insights gathered from interviews continue to have a broader impact on what is desired from the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              The content creators of the platform would like broader ways to promote their content through the site and they expect a better view of their
              sales information. The consumers expressed the need for a better way to browse content without first needing to search.
            </p>
            <p>
              These findings have led to 3 new product areas to be explored and developed further:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Marketing Dashboard/reporting</li>
              <li>Newsfeed format for content updates</li>
              <li>Advertising platform upgrade/s</li>
            </ul>
